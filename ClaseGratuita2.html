<h2>What is Structural Engineering?</h2></br>

<h3>Structural engineering is a branch of civil engineering that focuses on the elaboration of the frame of artificial constructions. Implies</h3>
<h3>the solidity, balance and flexibility of various structures, taking into account factors such as load and seismic resilience. It is a</h3>
<h3>part of civil engineering because it specifically addresses the design and stability of buildings and structures and encompasses the</h3>
<h3>planning and development of infrastructure for communities.</h3></br>

<h3>Structural engineering plays a vital role in ensuring the strength and reliability of construction projects, as the</h3>
<h3>engineers analyze loads, select materials, and comply with building codes to prioritize safety. When designing</h3>
<h3>By carefully designing the structure and load-bearing elements, structural engineers contribute to creating durable structures that can</h3>
<h3>withstand various forces.</h3></br>

<h2>Structural Engineering Topics</h2>

<h3>Structural engineering addresses vital aspects of creating safe and robust buildings. They contribute significantly to ensuring</h3>
<h3>reliability and durability of buildings and bridges by addressing susceptibility to earthquakes and assessing the stability and rigidity of</h3>
<h3>The structures.</h3></br></br>

<h2>Susceptibility to earthquakes:</br></h2>
<h3>Structural engineering is vital to prevent buildings from falling during earthquakes. Protects people in earthquakes by</h3>
<h3>the successful use of earthquake-resistant types of materials, revolutionary systems such as damping and insulation of the</h3> 
<h3>basis, and proper maintenance and management of the construction.</h3></br>

<h2>Structure stability:</br></h2>
<h3>In structural engineering, maintaining shape and preventing collapse under external forces is crucial to structural stability. The</h3> 
<h3>engineers employ design and analysis techniques, evaluating factors such as load conditions and material strength, to</h3> 
<h3>ensure that structures can withstand the expected loads without failing, protecting against collapse.</h3></br>

<h2>Structure Rigidity:</br></h2>
<h3>Structural rigidity refers to how long a specific structure can withstand without suffering deformation or failure during the</h3> 
<h3>examination. Engineers decide how rigid the materials and joints of the structures are, as well as the connections of the structures</h3> 
<h3>of the building to maintain its forms despite the influence of different external forces.</h3>
